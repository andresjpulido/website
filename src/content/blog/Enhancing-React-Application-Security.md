The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) provides valuable guidelines to improve the security of software. In 2021, the project identified 10 main categories representing key web application security challenges, as illustrated in the graph below:

Let's review some categories with some aspects to review in our applications

## Broken access control

Establish effective access control and authorization systems to verify that users possess the necessary permissions for accessing particular resources and executing tasks.

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- Libraries like React Router can help enforce access control rules in your React application, organize users into role-based groups to restrict access and define the data they can interact with..

## Cryptographic Failures

SSL certificates continue to be the norm for establishing encrypted connections between clients and servers. It’s important to consume services via HTTPS and ensure your app is hosted on a secure URL.

- Utilize tools such as Let’s Encrypt or Cloudflare for acquiring and administering SSL certificates for your React.js applications.
- Employ the HTTPS protocol to deliver your React app, guaranteeing encrypted communication between the client and server.

## Injection

Input from users may include harmful code or data capable of jeopardizing your application or server security. Similarly, output generated for users can inadvertently reveal sensitive information or facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- Sanitization involves the removal or encoding of potentially harmful characters or tags from input or output. Libraries such as DOMPurify or sanitize-html can assist in this process. Certain characters pose risks in specific contexts while being harmless in others, making it more logical to escape output in such cases.
- Employ HTML attributes such as ‘required’, ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘type’, etc., to enforce fundamental input validation.
- Optimize user experience and streamline validation processes by integrating third-party libraries. Packages like react-hook-form, Formik, and Yup offer extensive functionalities for handling forms, validating data, and managing errors.
- Avoid using the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, which bypasses the escaping mechanism and exposes you to XSS risks. If the use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML is unavoidable, ensure to sanitize user-generated content before rendering it.

## Security misconfiguration

Common causes of React security vulnerabilities include insufficiently configured HTTP headers and inadequate setups.

- Configure the backend server for your application.
- Avoid enabling directory listings.
- Conduct regular audits and scans to identify security misconfiguration.

Vulnerable and Outdated Components

- Utilize tools like npm audit or yarn audit to detect and rectify vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- Use Snyk for dependency monitoring and security measures, along with Dependabot for automated dependency updates.
- Use only reputable and actively maintained third-party libraries and components.
- Regularly assess and update dependencies to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- Ensure React JS and its dependencies are kept up-to-date to leverage the latest security enhancements and bug fixes.

## Identification and Authentication Failures

Incorporate robust authentication and session management into your React application. Employ widely accepted security protocols, including robust password hashing algorithms, secure storage methods for session tokens, and safeguards against session hijacking and fixation attacks.

- Implement recognized authentication libraries and frameworks like bcrypt for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session handling.
- Introduce strategies for token expiration and renewal. Utilizing short-lived access tokens alongside longer-lived refresh tokens can strike a balance between security and user convenience.
- Store tokens securely in cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags, avoiding the use of local storage.
- Limit the data stored in session objects to minimize the exposure of sensitive information.
- Leverage established authentication solutions such as Next.js Auth and Passport to manage authentication flows securely, as these libraries are purpose-built to address prevalent security issues.

## Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Integrate strong error management and logging systems within your React application. Take care to prevent the exposure of sensitive data in error messages and logs. Effectively manage exceptions and errors, and contemplate recording them in a secure and centralized repository for comprehensive monitoring and analysis.

- Solutions such as Sentry aid in capturing and analyzing errors within your React applications.

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF is a type of security vulnerability in web applications that enables an attacker to manipulate server requests sent from the vulnerable server. Typically, SSRF occurs when the application allows the attacker to specify the target URL for server-side requests.

- Utilize Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies on the server to restrict which domains can access sensitive resources. Configure CORS headers to only allow requests from trusted domains.

The Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. By defining a CSP, you can control the resources the browser is allowed to load for your website, preventing the execution of unauthorized scripts.

- Implementing CSP in a React.js application involves adding the appropriate HTTP header (Content-Security-Policy) to your web server’s responses. This header specifies which dynamic resources are allowed to load, effectively reducing the risk of XSS attacks by specifying trusted script sources and endpoints.
- Additionally, you should avoid using unsafe practices like inline event handlers or inline styles, as they might conflict with your CSP policy.

Consider how the cost escalates when failing to secure your application from the outset across various phases of your project. Refer to the following graph:
